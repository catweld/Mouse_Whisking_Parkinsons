In this analysis project, data was collected at the Karolinska Institute under experimental Parkinson’s
conditions in mice. The data was then analyzed with DeepLabCut and processed. The purpose of this project was to analyze the data in terms of syllables and build a classification
model that can distinguish between the healthy mice and mice with Parkinson’s disease. 

In this model, whisker angles and speeds are classified using kmeans and fed through an LSTM model for time series classification. The resulting classification accuracy is 98%.
